          <p>I am an aspiring Front-End Engineer from Colorado, teaching myself how to make responsive websites and apps.</p>
          <p>My primary goal is to earn my first job in this fun & creative industry.</p>
          <p>Every day is an opportunity I use to build on my knowledge of CSS, HTML, & JavaScript. I am excited to further my knowledge of JavaScript and learn how to build apps and websites using React and Typescript.</p>
          <p>My curriculum consists of concurrent studies from many sources, including (but not limited to):</p>

          <h3 class="history">A Brief History</h3>
          <p>My career up until now has been in the restaurant industry. In fact, I am currently bartending part-time nights to keep the lights on while learning to code every day.</p> 
          <p>I treat my education like a full-time job, spending the majority of my free time studying, building and breaking websites, developing good habits, and absorbing best practices as I progress.</p>
          <p>I am a life-long learner and have a wide variety of interests. I have a B.A. in Sociology from <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/" target="_blank">Colorado State University</a>, as well as a certification in <a href="https://coloradomtn.edu/campuses/rifle/" target="_blank">Solar Photovoltaic Installation</a>. I also understand a fair amount of Spanish, French, and am currently learning German on the <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/" target="_blank">Duolingo</a> app.</p>
          <p>I have been fortunate to have traveled to many places around the world. My favorite countries to visit outside of the U.S. (so far) are Ireland, New Zealand, Argentina, and Costa Rica. Check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wanderhammer/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page for a visual tour of some of my travels.</p>
          <p>My experiences traveling, studying, and bartending has introduced me to a wide variety of people and ideas. I have far too many stories to tell here. If you'd like to know more, please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
